Asynchronous Tasks With Django and Celery



This is a project to integrate Celery into a Django Project and create Periodic Tasks.
This project utilizes Python 3.4, Django 1.8.2, Celery 3.1.18, and Redis 3.0.2.




 “Celery is an asynchronous task queue/job queue based on distributed message passing. It is focused on real-time operation, but supports scheduling as well.” 
 
 
 
Setup
Make sure to activate a virtualenv, install the requirements. Then fire up the server and navigate to http://localhost:8000/ in your browser. You should see the familiar “Congratulations on your first Django-powered page” text. When done, kill the server.
Next, install Celery using pip:
$ pip install celery==3.1.18
$ pip freeze > requirements.txt
